        Blackjack is a table and card game played with decks of playing cards where the goal is to score
        higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.

        Each round, the player and the dealer are dealt two cards each. One of the dealer's cards will
        remain face down until the dealer's hand is later resolved. After being dealt the first two cards, the
        player can either hit or stand. To hit is to be dealt another card. To stand is to end your turn. As
        the player, you want the cards in your hand to total more than the cards in the dealer's hand without
        exceeding 21. Number cards count as their natural value. Face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) count
        as 10 points. Aces count as 11 points. A hand of two aces or an ace along with a ten or any face card
        is blackjack and wins against anything that isn't blackjack. Your hand totalling more than 21
        points is known as busting. If your hand busts, you immediately lose the round. You will hit until
        you are satisifed with your hand at which time you will stand. After standing, the dealer will resolve
        his or her hand by dealing into it cards until it totals 17 or more. If neither of the hands
        have busted, then the one with the highest score wins the round. If the hands are tied, the round is
        a push and neither hand wins. Your wins and losses are tracked at the top of the screen. After a
        round, the dealer will collect and discard the cards that are on the table and then begin dealing
        again. The dealer will combine the cards and reshuffle after dealing five hands.

        Before each round, you will bet an amount of money that your hand will beat the dealer's. If you win a
        round, you will receive from the dealer an amount equal to twice your bet. If the round
        is a push, the dealer will return to you your bet. If you lose the round, the dealer will take your bet.
        Your money is tracked at the top of the screen.
